      "description": "During the participatory workshop 'Shoulder to Shoulder', art workers living in Helsinki were invited to participate in a sewing circle where they had the opportunity to connect  the threads of their personal experiences regarding the precarity and insecurity of art work, mental health issues and bodies, and strategies of resistance and survival. The artists were given a platform to actively engage with my work materials by creating new sculptures. The collaborative artworks by Cynthia Blanchette, Ania Duldiier, Jon Dunn, Moe Louanjli, Ines Montalvao, Mathilde Palenius, Cami Ruohonen and Kamila Śladowska have been exhibited in Myymälä2 Gallery in Helsinki.",
      "details": "Workshop presented on 28.06.23 at Töölö library in Helsinki. Part of 'On the Texture of Feelings', an exhibition and public programme hosted by Myymälä2 Gallery and curated by Dare to Care collective. The project was supported by Culture Moves Europe, funded by the European Union and implemented by the Goethe-Institut, and TelepART Mobility Support, run by the Finnish Cultural and Research Institutes.",

      "description": "This performance focuses on the theme of pleasure in its broadest sense. It develops around a series of interviews  in which friends of the artists were asked to talk about the last time they experienced pleasure and to explain the physical sensations associated with it. The answers punctuate the tempo of the performance and the pace of the movements. 'Screens*Scream*Sex' explores choreographies that evoke moments of intimacy in a collective encounter on stage. Through the creation and realisation of different screens and live filming, as well as costumes, it becomes unclear where a body begins or ends and how bodies relate to each other.",

      "description": "The video work presents a short story that is partly autobiographical and partly fictional. It is a first-person narrative of the experience of a liquid, amorphous and ever-changing body. A body that is not only subject to its changing emotional state, which dictates its structure, but also to the difficulties of coping with everyday challenges such as rain, drinking, dripping and slipping. The audio accompanying the video is a field recording of a voice that is subsequently distorted and muffled, recreating the sensation of being underwater.",

This embodied hydrological cycle is every time different, although the water we are is always coming from somewhere and moving somewhere else, this water is always new, in its form, rhythm, meaning and potential. In the performance, products of common consumption are donated to represent the absolute essence of the body. The artificial colour and texture of the liquids is apparently not human, but in the drinking process they become part of the cycle. The video component of the work shows my body in contact with different liquids, while a background music with the sounds of my bodily fluids spreads through the gallery space embracing viewers during their visit.",

        "description": "An impression can be an effect on the subject's feelings (making an impression), as well as a mark on the subject's surface (leaving an impression). The skin acts as an archive of contact histories, recording past encounters with others. These experiences are recorded on the surface of the body, which nevertheless regenerates, offering new possibilities for interaction. Our surface always remains soft and adaptable and, while keeping us separate from others, mediates our relationship with the outside world. My textile sculptures present the body as a field for play and experimentation, the audience is invited to interact with the sculptures, caressing or squeezing them, and leaving their temporary imprint on them.",

        "description": "In the video I share the social criticism expressed in Chris Kraus' feminist novel “I Love Dick” (1997). In Kraus' partly autobiographical book the married protagonist devotes herself to an obsession with another man. She verbalises her desires in love letters to him. Only in the beginning her words actually address Dick, later she writes them rather in order to express her fantasies, to reify and live them out. This kind of approach was extremely familiar and useful for me in the acceptance of my asexuality: I had to gradually understand that the object of my desires was not a person specifically but desire itself.  The video mixes quotes from Kraus' and my own intimate thoughts to question the true meaning of intimacy and love and how to freely express these aspects of life without being forced to fit into social stereotypes.",
